# Diabetes-Predictor

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc. Machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, are employed for accurate prediction.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Collection

- **Sources**:
  -  PIMA Diabetes dataset from Kaggle.
- **Features**:
  -  Includes various health metrics and demographic information.

### 2. Data Preparation

- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Imputed missing values using strategies like mean substitution.
- **Feature Scaling**:
  - Standardized features using 'StandardScaler' to normalize data.

### 3. Model Training

- **Algorithm**:
  - SVM with a linear kernel chosen for its suitability in binary classification tasks.
- **Data Splitting**:
  - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- **Training**:
  - Fit the SVM model to the training data.

### 4. Evaluation

- **Metrics**:
  - Fit the SVM model to the training data.
- **Validation**:
  - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were conducted to optimize model performance.

### 5. Tools and Libraries

- **Python**:
  - Programming language used for implementation.
- **scikit-learn**:
  - Used for SVM model, data preprocessing, and evaluation.
- **numpy** and **pandas**:
  - Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Google Colab**:
  - Development environment for collaborative work and execution.

## Aim and Significance

This project aims to enhance early diabetes detection, which is critical for effective disease management and improving patient outcomes. This project contributes to the ongoing efforts in the medical field to develop automated and accurate diagnostic tools.
